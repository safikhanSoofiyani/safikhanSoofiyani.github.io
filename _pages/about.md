<!-- محمد صفی ارحمن خان صوفیانی -->

I am Safi (صفی), a second year PhD Student at the [Wadhwani School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/) @ [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) & [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/) Lab where I am advised by Prof. [Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/). My current research focuses on Resources and Evaluation of Multilingual Large 'X' Language Models (where X = '  ' or 'Vision' or 'Audio'). I am also currently a Research Fellow at [Sarvam](https://www.sarvam.ai/), helping in building Sovereign AI for India!

Previously, I was an AI Resident at the [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/) Lab at IIT Madras, where I was fortunate to be part of the [IndicLLMSuite](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicLLMSuite) (guided by Prof. [Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/)). I did my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering before that from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) (again!!) where I got to work on "Narrow Domain Adaptation of Speech Recognition Systems" guided by Prof. [Pratyush Kumar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-8844a8a3) and (you guessed it!) Prof. [Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/).
